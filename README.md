docker-wheezy-cloudtools
========================

The AWS CLI, GCE SDK and Ansible built on a minimal Google Wheezy.

**Why?**

There are existing images for each of these tools in isolation, but none that combine them. At the same time, the best or at least most notable image for each depend on varying baseimages making the task of combining them at least on par with devising a new build of my own.
